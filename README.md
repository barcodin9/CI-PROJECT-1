- Stray tag warnings remedied where could and then ignored as it was not affecting usability of the website.

## Unfixed Bugs 

- When moving the window from a standard 1920 x 1280 screen to the screen of a Macbook Air 14", the formatting of some elements mainly the footer element was not displaying properly, I was unable to remedy this on time.

## Depoloyment 
- The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows.
    - In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab
    - From the source section drop-down menu, select the Master Branch
    - Once the master branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.
